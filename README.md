NFT Marketplace Full Stack Project Welcome to the NFT Marketplace repository! This project is a comprehensive, full-stack NFT marketplace built using modern web technologies and blockchain. It leverages React for the front end, Solidity for writing smart contracts, MetaMask for handling blockchain interactions, and Hardhat for smart contract development and testing. This project demonstrates the integration of decentralized applications (dApps) with blockchain technology to create a functional and interactive NFT marketplace.

Features User Authentication: Users can connect their MetaMask wallet to authenticate and interact with the marketplace. NFT Minting: Users can mint their own NFTs directly on the platform. NFT Listing: Minted NFTs can be listed for sale on the marketplace. NFT Purchasing: Users can browse listed NFTs and make purchases securely. Transaction History: View the history of transactions made on the platform. Smart Contract Interaction: Fully functional interaction with Ethereum blockchain smart contracts. Responsive Design: Fully responsive design for seamless user experience across devices. Technologies Used Frontend:

React.js Redux (for state management) Web3.js (for blockchain interaction) Tailwind CSS (for styling) Backend:

Node.js Express.js Blockchain:

Solidity (smart contract development) Hardhat (development and testing framework) MetaMask (Ethereum wallet and blockchain interaction) Getting Started Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine:
